# Email Database Provider Comparisons  

The articles in this repo look at the competitive landscape of email list providers.  
Each post compares a different set of vendors, with an emphasis on real-world factors like:  
- Pricing transparency  
- GDPR / CAN-SPAM compliance  
- Data refresh cycles  
- Customer support  

We cover both mainstream options (ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lusha, Clearbit) and smaller but fast-growing providers such as LeadsBlue.com.  

The aim is to help buyers make informed decisions instead of relying only on big-budget marketing claims.
